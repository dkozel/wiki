## Process

1. Establishing learning goals
  * (e.g., A learner identifies desired accomplishment from a given learning experience. Goals may include mastering course content or learning information relevant to oneâ€™s career goals.)
2. Locate and access resources
  * (e.g., A learner identifies resources necessary for accomplishing a learning experience. Resources may include text- books, learning materials from the instructor, the Internet, the library, online discussions with peers, and interactions with the instructor.)
3. Adopt and execute learning activities
  * (e.g., A learner decides on a specific plan of action that is aligned with the established goals and the use of available resources. Activities include maintaining a calendarof assignments and projects, managing time to study at a steady pace,staying involved with class discussions and collaborating with others, and actively seeking feedback from others including the instructor.)
4. Monitor and evaluate performance
  * (e.g., A learner tracks and measures actual performance of results to previously established goals.Based on performance results, the learner can refine his or her learning activities and goals.)
5. Reassess learning strategies progress
  * (e.g., A learner self-reflects and re-examines the various activities completed to determine waysfor improving learning experience. This activity can lead to adjustments in one or more of the previous tasks to improve learning results and meet established goals. In addition, this activity will help students to better prepare themselves for further participation in learning environments.)
